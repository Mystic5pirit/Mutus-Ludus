# Mutus-Ludus
 This is a game made for the Pirate Software 15 Game Jam with the prompt "Shadows and ALchemy."

This game is a platformer/bullet hell/shoot 'em up. The player plays as an animated blob of ink and the goal is to defeat the beings from the alchemical book _Mutus Liber_. 

In the case I continue working on this, I plan on finishing all of the pages in _Mutus Liber_ (approximately 15 pages).

The biggest thing I learned from this experience is the importance of a game design document, the fact that art takes a while to make, and most importantly, the need to check that the right thing was submitted.
